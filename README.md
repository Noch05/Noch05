## Hi there 👋  I'm Noah

I'm an undergraduate student at American University, studying Mathematics, Economics, and Political Science. My passion involves applying quantitative methods to Political and Economic policy questions, whether it be traditional statistics, Bayesian methods, or machine learning concepts. 

These are some of the areas I'm currently working in:
- **Adaptive Experimental Designs** and **Multi-Arm Bandits** 
   * I'm currently developing an R package that re-analyzes randomized controlled trials as adaptive designs using Thompson sampling or UCB1 decision algorithms. Repo will be made public when possible.
   * This package will be used to re-analyze experimental data from various traditional public policy experiments, resulting in an academic paper.
- **Machine Learning**:
   * I've finished a paper examining the utility of using survey data and simple machine learning models to perform political donor classification. Currently looking for presentation/publication opportunities, and the repo will be made public when possible.

These are some of the projects I've completed:
- **Causal Inference with Observational Data**
  * I've completed a paper studying the impacts of city managers on municipal turnout, using the most recent dataset available, and propensity score matching techniques to draw causal inferences from observational data. The paper was just published in the Spring 2025 edition of American University's undergraduate journal, Clocks and Clouds, and it can be found [here](https://edspace.american.edu/clocksandclouds/wp-content/uploads/sites/115/2025/04/Spring-2025-Final-Publication-Digital.pdf). [Repo](https://github.com/Noch05/city_managers). The [repository](https://github.com/Noch05/city_managers) with the code is also public.
