## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Noah

I'm an undergraduate student at American University, studying Mathematics, Economics, and Political Science. My passion involves applying quantitative methods and techniques to Political and Economic policy questions, whether it be traditional statistics, Bayesian methods, or machine learning concepts.

- I'm currently working on a paper creating machine learning models to classify political donors and non-donors. The repo will be public soon.
- I just finished a paper studying the impacts of city managers on municipal turnout, it's published [here](https://edspace.american.edu/clocksandclouds/wp-content/uploads/sites/115/2025/04/Spring-2025-Final-Publication-Digital.pdf). [Repo](https://github.com/Noch05/city_managers) is public for replication.
